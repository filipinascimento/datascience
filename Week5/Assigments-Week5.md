## Exploratory Data Analysis Assignment

1. Choose at least 2 datasets from the Datasets folder that have not been used in this class.
2. Apply the techniques learned in this class to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the selected datasets.
3. Use descriptive statistics to summarize the main characteristics of the datasets.
4. Utilize basic data visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and line plots to gain insights into the data.
5. Identify and handle outliers and missing values in the datasets.
6. Perform multivariate analysis to explore relationships between different features.
7. Use correlation analysis to identify connections between features (Pearson or/and Spearman).
8. Apply dimension reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and non-linear methods to simplify the datasets.
9. Observe if the patterns are described by associated metadata (e.g., categories, binary fields, etc)
10. Create a Python notebook to document your analysis, including your findings and plots.
11. Keep in mind that trying several methods and not finding patterns is also a valid result.

Good luck with your exploratory data analysis!
